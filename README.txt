Please carefully follow the instructions written on the wall for making it work properly. 

Pressing the same buttons would bring back things to normal. Each button acts as a toggle to view issues.

It's best to experience this project while sitting. 

Small explanations of the issues:
Vergence accomodation - Objects comes uncomfortably close to the eyes.
Binocular disparity - Same objects different colors.
Bad visuals - You will see some objects in one eye only.
